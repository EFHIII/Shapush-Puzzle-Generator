- Host sends the device a sequence of many puzzles
- Device solves each puzzle in parallel
  - Device further splits each puzzle computing each 'next move' in parallel
- device sends the host:
  - if puzzle was solvable
  - minimum moves to solve each puzzle
  - size of space searched
  - solved board state
- host evaluates the result sent from the device to give each board a score
- host reports back the top scoring boards to the user
